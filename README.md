Parse Exon and Mask non-exonic regions in the repeat and polymorphism masked sequences:
================================================

Description
================================================

For each of the repeat and polymorphism masked sequences, the correpsonding exon coordinates are extracted from ZmB73_5a.59_WGS.gff.gz.tmp file.

This is based on their chr no and start and stop positions. Regions outside of the exon coordinates are masked out as X.
                
This non-exon masked sequence can be used for designing LR PCR primers.
